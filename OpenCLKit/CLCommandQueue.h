 *  command queues can exists for a single device but only one device can be
 *  attached to each command queue. The CLKernel and CLBuffer objects you use
 *  on a command queue must belong to the same CLContext as the device.
 *
 *  Kernels and data transfer tasks in the same CLCommandQueue will always be
 *  executed in the same order they were enqueued, i.e. each operation waits for
 *  the preceding operation to finish. Multiple command queues using the same
 *  device may be executed in parallel, depending on the device hardware
 *  capabilities and OpenCL implementation.
